# SNAP EOPF Prototype Reader for Sentinel-2 L2A Products

This repository contains the development of a prototype SNAP reader for the new **EOPF Sentinel-2 Level-2A Zarr samples**, 
as published by the **EOPF Zarr Sample Service**. The goal of this prototype is to demonstrate compatibility between 
the EOPF Zarr format and the SNAP ecosystem.

> **Note:**
> - This reader is a **prototype** and currently supports only **Sentinel-2 L2A** products in Zarr format.  
> - Support for other product types will be added in future development stages in the SNAP project.  
> - This repository is actively **under development** and subject to change.
